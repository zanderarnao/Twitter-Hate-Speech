Topic Catalogue
================

Below is the catalogue of topics as seen in the visualization of the
main report document. I bolded the topics that are more clear and are
thus regarded as notable. A question mark indicates a particular unknown
terms which might lead to a topic determination. “Unknown” indicates an
inability for me to interpret the results.

Once again, apologies for any offense caused by my usage of a term here.
I have no formal training in the area of hate speech, and the below
represents my best attempt to categorize these hateful posts in an
inoffensive way. Please, let me know if you have any suggested changes
