# An Analysis of Hate Speech on Twitter

### For this report, you will need the following libraries:

### Overview: 

In this working project, I analyzed topic patterns in hate speech data taken from Twitter. Using Latent Dirichlet allocation, I modeled the topics present in posts that were coded as hate speech. I then visualized 36 of those topics, interpreted the topics, and finally came to conclusions about patterns in the topics represent. I plan to return to this analysis at a later date. 

Note: The scripts in the pull request are not needed to replicate this analysis. Simply run the .Rmd. I used them initially for coding (I prefer the interface) and include them as a matter of practice.
